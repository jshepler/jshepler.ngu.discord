## Installation
As with my [mod pack](https://github.com/jshepler/jshepler.ngu.mods), this mod uses [BepinEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) v5.4.21. If you don't already have BepinEx installed, download the `BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0.zip` file from [that release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21).

Extract the contents of the zip file

to NGU Idle's game folder `...\Steam\steamapps\common\NGU IDLE`.
